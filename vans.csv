It has 68500 miles and within the last year I did the following: - New clutch- New tires (two purchased within the last couple of months)- New breaks / rotors - New Rear struts (I think rear can't remember if it was front or rear)- Some other stuff that I can't honestly remember. Probably put about $3K into over the last year to make it like new. Note: Car was declared ""Total Loss"" which just meant the repair would cost too much. I was rear ended a year ago as the carfax will show (See picture). You can barely see the damage to the car (dent in rear driver side) It drives great and is ready for you to own. Some water is leaking into the rear seat well found the culprit. Debris gets caught in holes in the sunroof that are meant to drain to below the car. If it's blocked it flows into the rear seat well. I'll have my mechanic resolve it simple fix though I could do it myself but don't want to accidentally mess up a clip or something.    "

The car is NOT the prettiest but I'm confident it's in better mechanical shape than many other cars on Craigslist.  Car is inspected until next year.   Just had the head gasket done about 15k mikes ago. Paperwork for proof is available and will provide to buyer to keep.   All sensors pertaining to the engine like heat sensors etc replaced. Brand new radiator last year...the car was my wife's work car a lot of highway miles but always maintained with Mobil synthetic oil.  The car runs and drives very very well you have to drive it.  Comes with a pandora ready CD player as well.  Test drive it before hand (recently replaced the oxygen sensor bank 1 area) but it's the wrong part...so since I'm selling it i really don't have the time to deal with it.  Other than that...maybe a set of front tires (federals i paid $55 for each) the rear ones are about 70-75% there so no need to replace that...brakes were done 10k mikes ago but maybe in a few months could use new ones (cheap!! On this car like $50-$65 for front pad replacement) overall we would keep it since we pay $50 a month in Ca insurance for it but we don't have the room in our driveway.  Let me know if you would like to schedule a viewing and a drive.  Car is still fully insured and registered so it's ready to be tested anytime any day.  Thanks Please use the Craigslist link to email me and leave me a number and name so i can call you (sorry too many scammers on here)  if you don't include your name and number so i can contact you then i won't repsond to your email.  Thank you  -KC

2002 fully loaded Nissan Pathfinder,https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/d/2002-fully-loaded-nissan/6770809000.html,1650,Baldwin,,172000,good,6,4wd,gas,grey,full-size,clean,automatic,SUV,2002,nissan,pathfinder 4wd,        This truck is in solid condition with some minor wear and tear due to its age. The initial owner had it fully loaded with Bose radio and speakers heated front seats. Everything to this date is in original state. I had it checked by a Nissan Mechanic that uses only Authentic Nissan parts. Everything works from AC to heated front seat to second lever four wheel drive shifter. This is a monster in the snow  does not even need to engage the 4L. Why am I selling it? I was using the car for my job which involves a lot of driving. I have a more fuel efficient car now so I no longer need the car. It has been seating in my driveway for about 5-6 months with minimum driving from and to Home Depot (1-2 miles every soo often) and the more it stays the more likely something will go wrong. So I decided to give it way to someone who might need it.What is wrong with the car?The car has an air control valve issue and no catalytic converter. What does that mean?When you first start the car you need to give it a little gas to get it to idle by itself otherwise it will shut down.And for the catalytic converter it only affects the inspection due to the engine light but does not affect the driving of the car.

The timing belt was changed this month. 2009 was the last year of this Subaru Outback generation body style. It is also the last year before Subaru switched to the CVT Transmission which is known to have many problems.It is powered by the bulletproof 2.5 liter horizontally opposed 4-cylinder subaru boxer engine that gets 26 mpg highway with AWD. This engine is a proven engine for subaru and is very dependable.The power gets to the wheels through a 5-speed automatic transmission with subaru's sport-shift mode  followed by a limited slip differential and governed by Subaru's infamous and patented SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVE system. Subaru's are notorious for their handling on loose/slick/snowy surfaces because of the symmetrical AWD.  These Outback's are known to out perform most SUV's when it comes to driving in bad weather and hazardous road conditions. The Heavy Duty Raised Independent Suspension that is standard on the 2009 outback gives it as much ground clearance as a jeep grand cherokee (8.4 inches) not to mention a maximum cargo capacity of 61.7 cu. ft. in the wagon. This subaru came with some convenient options that were offered in 2009 including heated front seats power driver's seat cruise control power everything a/c fog lights roof rails with cross bars and All Weather Subaru floor mats below all the seats as well as the trunk mat.Asking a very fair price of $8900 slightly negotiable but please don't low ball. In no rush to sell. You wont find another one like it locally with this mileage I've looked.CASH ONLY NO CHECKS NO SCAMS. NO NEGOTIATING OVER PHONE. IN PERSON ONLY. CAR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. COME SEE IT. Please call or text to make an appointment to see the car. Located in Port Jefferson NY. Will not be available for very long. Thank You for Reading!

➥ 2006 Toyota Camry XLE Dirt CHEAP! Leather Sunroof perfect interior,https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/cto/d/2006-toyota-camry-xle-dirt/6765801942.html,2050,Jackson Heights,,89000,excellent,6,fwd,gas,grey,full-size,clean,automatic,sedan,2006,toyota,camry,        This is Toyota Camry XLE but it has EVERY SINGLE OPTION known to man. And woman. Only 89 miles! It is basically like a Lexus. Clean title in hand. Put it on your credit card (I have a card reader). Or pay cash. Whatever is easier for you.Leather.Sunroof.Premium aluminum wheels.Touchscreen.Navigation.Satellite radio (Sirius and XM).Heated seats.Power seats mirrors and windows.Cruise control.SUPER CLEAN! Basically better than NEW. Because it looks like new and does not have a price of a new car.3.0 (VVT-i V6) engine. The engine is 100% running. Better than new! Tires have plenty of treads left. EVERYTHING is working.The car was hit while parked and has damaged rear quarter panel and little damage on the bumper. You can pick up the car in person or ship it. Car runs fine but you can not drive it fast or register it before the quarter panel is fixed.Special price for the auto body shop: $2050 in As Is condition. Just the engine leather wheels navigation and parts are more. If I fix it COMPLETELY at the auto body shop price will be $4350. Bring your mechanic if you want him to check the car. But you don't need to because the car is great anyway.If you are NY resident do not forget that you will also need to pay: $230 to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles for plates ($70 if you are transferring existing plates)$37 for NY state inspection and you need to insure the car before I give it to you.If you do not properly insure and register the car police will ticket the car $65 per day and I do not want to be responsible for that.You will have these added state expenses with every single car and that is the law for all but I am getting too many calls from people who do not know that so here it is again just in case.Este es Toyota Camry XLE pero tiene CADA OPCIÓN ÚNICA. Sólo 89 millas! Es básicamente como un Lexus. Título limpio en la mano.Ponlo en tu tarjeta de crédito (tengo un lector de tarjetas). O pagar en efectivo. Lo que sea más fácil para ti.Cuero.Techo solarLlantas de aluminio premium.Pantalla táctil.Navegación.Radio satelital (Sirius y XM).Asientos con calefacción.Asientos eléctricos espejos y ventanas.Control de crucero¡SUPER LIMPIO! Básicamente mejor que NUEVO. Porque parece nuevo y no tiene el precio de un auto nuevo.Motor 3.0 (VVT-i V6).El motor está funcionando al 100%. Mejor que nuevo! A los neumáticos les quedan muchas pisadas. TODO está funcionando.El auto fue golpeado mientras estaba estacionado y ha dañado el panel del cuarto trasero y poco daño en el parachoques. Puede recoger el coche en persona o enviarlo. El auto funciona bien pero no puede conducirlo rápido ni registrarlo antes de que se arregle el panel del cuarto.Precio especial para el taller de carrocería: $ 2050 en condición As Is. Sólo el motor el cuero las ruedas la navegación y las piezas son más.Si lo arreglo COMPLETAMENTE al precio del taller de carrocería será de $ 4350. Traiga a su mecánico si quiere que revise el auto. Pero no es necesario porque el coche es genial de todos modos.Si usted es residente de Nueva York no olvide que también deberá pagar:$ 230 al Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados de Nueva York para placas ($ 70 si está transfiriendo placas existentes)$ 37 por la inspección del estado de Nueva York y necesita asegurar el automóvil antes de que se lo entregue.Si no asegura y registra correctamente el automóvil la policía emitirá un boleto de $ 65 por día y no quiero ser responsable de eso.Tendrá estos gastos estatales adicionales con cada automóvil y esa es la ley para todos pero recibo demasiadas llamadas de personas que no lo saben así que aquí está nuevamente por si acaso.

Excellently maintained all services done at Infiniti. I was given another car and I don't need two now but I would've never put her for sale. I have the Title of ownership. You can run the VIN number if you want. This car has another 5 excellent years in it at least. 1 previous owner one lady doctor from the state of Indiana (first 96K miles all highway) and myself the majority of the rest of miles trips from Virginia to NY (highway too).*BEST FEATURE: The feature that I love the most is Adaptive (Autonomous) Cruz Control. The part alone is $2500.Asking for a fair price of $5600.00 (the price valuation from Virginia DMV and average of Kelly's Blue Book is $5800). You'll not be disappointed. I'll listen to the best offer as well but I'm not in a rush to sell it. This car is only for those who appreciate it. Better text me (a lot of telemarketers call nowadays) to take a look and possibly road test the car. Aaron

It has 129k miles on it.  I've recently upgraded to an SUV and no longer need the Prius. The Prius is in excellent mechanical condition. It has some small nicks and dents which is to be expected from a car being parked in New York City (see photos). The car has 4 tires in good condition and the Prius has been serviced by me consistently every 3-4 months over the last 2 - 3 years I've owned the car. It has a backup camera and I am selling the car with an AUX Bluetooth adapter and a cell phone mount. The Prius is a very practical car with lots of space for storage as well as exceptional gas mileage. This car is eligible for Clean Pass or HOV access with only 1 person on the Long Island Expressway in Nassau and Suffolk County. I have pulled a Carfax for my car and I have shared it in my photos of the car. The car is very reliable and has had no check engine lights since I've owned the car. Best to reach out to me via craigslist relay to set up a time to see the car or ask any pertinent questions about the car. Transaction is in cash and serious buyers are best.Thanks for your interest!

They only made 4000 of these babies and this is one of just a handful on the road.Made from 1975 to 1977. This fine red car was restored in 2003 from a good sound body. It was garaged before AND AFTER restoration.NEW biscuit connolly leather Jaguar hide seats - looks like it rolled out of Coventry yesterday.Rare bright Jaguar red. Original black vinyl roof. The car is 98% original - right down to the jaguar hubcaps and the original jack in the trunk.New electronic fuel pump. Purrs like a cat!These are hard to find and when you do - they've been messed around with. If you were to refinish the walnut (They sell the panels on eBay for $350) - it could be a show winner!Smooth 6 cylinder engine straight out of the race bred XKE-Type and the finest walnut burr veneers Wilton carpets and British leather. I've had my bodyshop go over the vehicle and this is a very solid car. The leather seats are immaculate. The engine is quiet and moves through the automatic transmission beautifully.I've updated the photos with an underside inspection - based on some buyer's interest in the car (and it's unibody construction.) Original under-seal is evident. No holes! No structural damage - this is a very dry car that was always garaged.• New brake rotors calipers pads and hoses (front)• New inboard brake pads and disks (rear)• New Gas-A-Just shock absorbers (front)• New automatic transmission with torque converterFrame and floorpans are 100%. Even where the undersea has chipped off - there is only light surface rust.The rear valance panel has some scratches between the exhausts the power steering belt has a slight squeak on full lock. Overall - amazing bones for a 43 year old car. The carpet shows some wear - but there are a host of suppliers stocking the Wilton footwell carpetsPress the gas and she takes off way faster than an injection XJ6. Twin Strombergs make a great sucking noise. Just add a little choke on a cold start and this XJ straight 6 will run all day.This is one of just a few hundred with this striking color combination. A great investment - destined to double or triple in value with careful stewardship.Starts with one turn of the key and evokes the ""space grace and pace"" that made Jaguar one of the greatest British luxury marques.Walk around of the vehicle will be posted shortly.Remember that you are bidding to buy the car. Not inspect it. So check with your wife.A $2000 non refundable deposit is required within 24 hours - or the item will be re-listed. Full payment in cash / check within 7 days or the car will be re-listed. Checks must clear before the vehicle is shipped.A clear Minnesota title is in hand. Viewing in Montclair NJ.

It has about 248k miles on it. The body has 0% rust. It can't because the body is 100% aluminum. The bare shell of the car weighs about 1600 lbs and before the Tesla model 3 it was the only mass produced car with the lowest drag coefficient (0.25). All of those things means that its a great project car for drag racing and track racing. The car comes with the motor and transmission and hybrid system. The hybrid system works intermittently it may be due to a bad ground. Motor and transmission run pretty strong and currently getting about 50.5 mpg.

It has come to the point where I do not want to invest more money into repairs so now it's up for sale. Issues:Rear main seal leaks oil. This is the most recent issue which I've decided not to fix due to the cost.Sometimes the engine temperature gauge goes to high but the engine doesn't overheat. Which is why I replaced the radiator the thermostat and both coolant temperature sensors. This didn't fix why the gauge goes to the hot side intermittently.Heater works but only on the passenger side. Drivers side blows lukewarm but it still blows. I've searched every blog and forum to resolve this issue and have replaced the 2 parts that many suggest and also reverse flushed the heater core to no avail. The car still gets toasty inside and the windshield still defrosts so it's not an immediate issue. I replaced the blend door actuator and the heater control valve.Some of the lights of the heater control buttons don't light up and sometimes they do.Some of the parts replaced since ownership:This year I've replaced the front struts front pads and rotors are brand new the heater blend door heater valve thermostat both coolant temperature sensors rear passenger door motor and all interior lights replaced with LED's.Other parts replaced in the past were the radiator and the tires (last year). Both purchased new.2 years ago replaced the A/C Compressor and had the system recharged and serviced at Walts in north Seattle.It's a rebuilt title. I purchased the van from a co-worker and the van sustained front end damage from him rear ending another car. He got the car fixed and I bought it from him.I've been driving this van for 4 years and planned on keeping it much longer but I don't want to put more money into it. It's time to let her go.I am being completely honest with the issues and the repairs or parts I've replaced.  I will not lie or embellish any issues regarding the van. That being said I will allow you to have the van inspected at your cost. Or you can just ask me any questions and I'll be perfectly up front. This van is not a quick flip kind of deal for me. This was my daily driver for 4 years. Had it not been for the recent oil leak I'd be keeping it. Call or text any questions.BrianI have the title in hand and in my name. $2500 cash onlyIf you want to come take a look and test drive we will meet at my home in Lakeridge (south Seattle).PLEASE do not text or ask what my bottom dollar is. If you're serious about buying it then schedule a time to see it and we can go from there. Thank you.

2008 BMW M3 (E92 M3) - Lightly Modified OEM Competition Wheels,https://denver.craigslist.org/cto/d/2008-bmw-m3-e92-m3-lightly/6769864028.html,16495,,WBSWD93538PY41476,81000,good,8,rwd,gas,black,mid-size,rebuilt,automatic,coupe,2008,bmw,328i,        Up for sale is my E92 BMW M3. If you're looking for a fairly cheap entry into a screaming V8 coupe this is your chance. The S65 engine found in the E9X M3 is one of the best engines to ever come out of BMW and it's probably going to stay that way considering where BMW is going with their M cars. The S65 revs all the way up to a blistering 8400 RPM which is almost unheard of especially for a V8. For comparison a C7 Corvette Stingray's V8 will only rev to 6500 RPM that means this car will out-scream an LS for almost a whole 2000 RPM and trust me it's something you need to experience. To compliment the S65's ridiculous redline my M3 is fitted with a full exhaust system that just sounds immense; but yes it still passes emissions. On the exterior of the car you can find a carbon fiber diffuser a carbon fiber trunk lip a carbon fiber front lip carbon fiber mirrors and OEM BMW Competition wheels found on the Competition pack M3s starting in 2011. In the engine bay all you'll find is an AFE air intake. My M3 is also sprayed in jerez black paint which is considered by many including myself to be the best color to come on the E9X M3 it looks black in photos but it's actually a ver deep blue it needs to be seen in the sun. Navigation and heated seats are also fitted on this M3. This car is an an experience to drive. I've owned and driven a lot of sports cars and this is still the favorite one I've driven to this day. I've only decided to part with it because I have my eyes on something new that's going to force me to part with this car. In the future I plan on owning another E92 M3 that's how great this car is.Onto the bad this car has rebuilt title and unfortunately it recently got stuck in one of Colorado's many hail storms earlier this year. I never got around to getting the damage fixed so I've just left it for the time being however I may be getting it repaired in the next couple weeks and if I do the price will go up. The reason for the rebuilt title was a minor and I mean very minor front end collision. The passenger headlight and bumper both got replaced. The car was totaled out due to $8000 worth of damage back in 2015 at 50000 miles when the car was still worth around $35000 according to Copart. I have full documentation of the accident as well as records for the repairs that were made. I tend to stay away from rebuilt title cars however after seeing photos of the car before being repaired I felt safe. Back onto the good I have full service records for this car for the last 4 years. The oil was changed around 2000 miles ago with 10w-60 oil from a local euro shop. This car has been very well-maintained during its life in fact the man that I purchased it from's dad's business partner was a mechanic for BMW for 8 years and he personally inspected and worked on the car during his ownership. Cosmetically this car can definitely use some work to clean things up however mechanically this car is perfect. BMWs have a reputation for being hard on the wallet but not the E92 M3 and mine has been flawless during my ownership just make sure to have some money put away for gas! Finally this M3 is equipped with the 7-speed DCT as opposed to a 6 speed manual that can also be found on E9X M3s. I've owned 4 manual sports cars in my life and this was my first DCT car. At first I was a bit hesitant but trust me when I say you're going to have just as much fun if not more fun with the dual-clutch transmission it shifts very quickly and it's an absolute blast to downshift and hear that exhaust. Not to mention it's faster than a manual.If you have any questions or you would like to come take a look at the car please feel free to email call or text me. I can send over any service records or documentation of the accident at your request so please ask!Rebuilt title in handThanks for looking!BMW M3 M4 335i E92 F80 328i S4 S5 C63 E63 GT-R

Extremely solid one owner car that was last registered in 2012. It was parked due to the brakes going bad. (master cylinder? New one included). After sitting it fired right up with only a fresh battery and gas. The motor sounds great and the oil looks good but after sitting it developed a coolant leak at the top radiator hose. It has the Florida title from 1992 signed off and ready for the next owner ( no notary required). I found it was gonna do the maintenance and use it as a driver but health issues came up (57yo with a bad knee) Now it needs to go. - 87 300ZX t-top 2 seat car that's super solid- body gaps all even. Never hit per previous owner- t-top don't leak. Seals are soft. Can be used as intended.- original paint (faded)- ALL stock everywhere. Except the radio- solid everywhere including underside. No major rust issues at all. - pop up headlights work fine- original t-top bags and Sun shades included- original factory owners and service manual- original rims with center caps- original under the hood (new battery) - seats and upholstery good- carpet good- lights wipers blower motor windows locks all work- no dash cracks. Dash is nice- as found condition. Not messed with at all.Problems found- coolant leak at top radiator hose (new hoses included)- brakes. Feels like a bad master cylinder (new one included)- drivers side inside door handle don't work- hoses and belts are still original (one new belt included)- timing belt service has not been done- tires completely shot (one flat)- hood and hatch struts need replacedThat's what I've found. Its a nice example of one of these cars that used to be often seen but all of them just rusted away up here. Here is a solid one. Just 3 outer body rust spots smaller than a silver dollar (see pics). Best of all its such a complete original car. That's why I bought it. Mechanical things can be fixed but without major rust to deal with it would make this a great winter project. 80's cars are going up in value and this one was one of the popular 80's cars. Haggerty price guide has this car at $2850 in #4 condition. This one is better than a #4 in a lot of ways. Price is fair. I'm not gonna budge too much on this because it's a southern solid car that's been away from the coast and road salt. Imagine an LS swap? Please call after 10am.  .
